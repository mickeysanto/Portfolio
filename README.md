### Projects
<a href="https://github.com/mickeysanto/Micronaut/tree/main">Micronaut</a> (2022)
- Micronaut is a first-person, VR, planetary exploration game that I made for my Immersive Media VR development class
- Players can select from two different miniature-sized planets to roam around and explore
- The planets are spherical and the player can walk completely around the planet in any direction they choose
- Each one of the planets is unique and is filled with little points of interest that the player can discover and there are 
  simple AI NPCs on the planets that the player can look at
- Micronaut was developed for the Oculus Quest 2 in Unity with the programming done in C# 
- All the assets were modeled by hand in Blender

<a href="https://github.com/mickeysanto/Little-World">Little World</a> (2023)
- A simple ecosystem simulation that is populated by AI NPCs and a controllable player character
- Each AI NPC has their own health and hunger meter and need to eat to survive
- Herbivore NPCs eat berries that spawn on bushes and Carnivores eat other NPCs
- Each NPC spawns in with randomly generated stats like: health, attack damage, speed, etc.
- NPCs also have a fight or flight resonse where when they are hit they either run away or fight
- The player can control an animal to participate in the ecosystem and has to eat and fight to survive

- A hack and slash, dungeon crawler video game made Jason Zhang, Jessica Nefflen, Kyle White, Josiah Kim, and myself 
  for my games programming class

  attack, retreat, and spawn other AI
- Developed in Unity & coded in C#
