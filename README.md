Micronaut
- Micronaut is a first-person, VR, planetary exploration game where players can select from two different miniature-sized 
  planets to roam around and explore I made for my Immersive Media VR development class
- The planets are spherical and the player can walk completely around the planet in any direction they choose
- Each one of the planets is unique and is filled with little points of interest that the player can discover and there are 
  simple AI NPCs on the planets that the player can look at
- Micronaut was developed for the Oculus Quest 2 in Unity with the programming done in C# 
- All the assets were created by hand in Blender
