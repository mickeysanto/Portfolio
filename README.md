### Projects

<a href="https://github.com/mickeysanto/ARcade">ARcade</a> (2024)
- ARcade is an augmented reality-based, tower defense videogame I developed as my solo senior project
- Players control and move two laser gun "towers" that are spawned in on trigger images to shoot down
  waves of enemy robots that are trying to attack your home base
- The more robots you defeat, the higher your score rises, but if too many robots make it to your
  home base, the base will be destroyed and you will lose
- As your laser guns defeat more robots, they level up and get upgrade points to upgrade their stats like damage,
  fire rate, and firing range
- The game was developed to be an endless arcade game where you try to score as high as you can
- ARcade was made within Unity with the coding done in C#, modeling done in Blender, soundtrack
  produced in Ableton Live, and the AR image tracking done with Vuforia Engine


<a href="https://github.com/mickeysanto/Micronaut/tree/main">Micronaut</a> (2022)
- Micronaut is a first-person, VR, planetary exploration game that I made for my Immersive Media VR development class
- Players can select from two different miniature-sized planets to roam around and explore
- The planets are spherical and the player can walk completely around the planet in any direction they choose
- Each one of the planets is unique and is filled with little points of interest that the player can discover and there are 
  simple AI NPCs on the planets that the player can look at
- Micronaut was developed for the Oculus Quest 2 in Unity with the programming done in C# 
- All the assets were modeled by hand in Blender

<a href="https://github.com/mickeysanto/Little-World">Little World</a> (2023)
- A simple ecosystem simulation that is populated by AI NPCs and a controllable player character
- Each AI NPC has their own health and hunger meter and need to eat to survive
- Herbivore NPCs eat berries that spawn on bushes and Carnivores eat other NPCs
- Each NPC spawns in with randomly generated stats like: health, attack damage, speed, etc.
- NPCs also have a fight or flight resonse where when they are hit they either run away or fight
- The player can control an animal to participate in the ecosystem and has to eat and fight to survive

<a href="https://github.com/mickeysanto/Fi-Melior">Fi Melior</a> (2023)
- A hack and slash, dungeon crawler video game made Jason Zhang, Jessica Nefflen, Kyle White, Josiah Kim, and myself 
  for my games programming class
- I developed the enemy NPC AI for the game which have multiple states in which they can advance towards the player,
  attack, retreat, and spawn other AI
- Developed in Unity & coded in C#
